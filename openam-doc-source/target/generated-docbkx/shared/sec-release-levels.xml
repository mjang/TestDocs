 <title>ForgeRock Product Release Levels</title>

 <para>ForgeRock defines Major, Minor, and Maintenance product release levels.
  The release level is reflected in the version number. The release level tells
  you what sort of compatibility changes to expect.</para>
 
 <variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>Major (version: x.0.0)</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>Major releases bring big new features. Major releases can include
     changes even to stable interfaces. Major releases can remove previously
     deprecated functionality, and in rare cases remove evolving functionality
     that has not been explicitly deprecated. Major releases also include the
     changes present in previous Minor and Maintenance releases.</para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
   <term>Minor (version: x.y.0)</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>Minor releases may include new features, backwards-compatible changes
     to stable interfaces in the same Major release, and incompatible changes
     to evolving interfaces. Minor releases can remove previously deprecated
     functionality. Minor releases also include the changes present in
     Maintenance releases.</para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
   <term>Maintenance (version: x.y.z)</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>Maintenance releases may include bug fixes and are intended to be
     fully compatible with previous versions from the same Minor release.</para>
