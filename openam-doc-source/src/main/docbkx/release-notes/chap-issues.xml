 <!-- TODO: Note for the final release
 <important>
  <para>This release resolves a number of issues, including security issues in
  OpenAM. It is strongly recommended that you update to this release to make

  <title>Limitations</title>

  <!-- For OPENAM-1886 TODO: Remove when this is fixed after 10.1.0-Xpress -->
  <para>When session failover is configured to use external OpenDJ directory
  servers, OpenAM must access those directory servers through an LDAP load
  balancer that can fail over connections from OpenAM whenever a directory
  server goes offline. Otherwise, sessions could continue to persist after
  users logout of OpenAM.</para>

  <para>Do not run different versions of OpenAM together in the same OpenAM
  site.</para>

  <para>When deploying OpenAM components on Microsoft Windows in an IPv6 environment,
  you must use the Java 7 Development Kit on Windows (due to <link xlink:show="new"
  xlink:href="http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6230761">JDK-6230761</link>,
  which is fixed only in Java 7).</para>

  <para>The Database Repository type of data store is experimental and not
  supported for production use.</para>

  <!-- Fix for OPENAM-1032: Add details to the release notes and documentation of OpenAM (for 875) -->
  <para>By default OpenAM does not enforce session quotas when running in Site
  mode without session failover. To work around this behavior, set the server
  configuration property
  <literal>openam.session.useLocalSessionsInMultiServerMode=true</literal>.
  You can set this property in OpenAM console under Configuration &gt; Servers
  and Sites &gt; Servers &gt; Server Name &gt; Advanced.</para>

  <para>The XUI is experimental and not supported for production use. The only
  language locale available for the XUI at this time is US English, in the
  <filename>/path/to/openam/webapps/XUI/locales</filename> directory.</para>

  <para>
   On hosts with pure IPv6 networks, OpenAM configuration has been seen to fail
   while starting the embedded OpenDJ directory server
   (<link xlink:show="new"
